![New Vibe game colour palette](<assets/documentation-media/Game-colours-active.png>)

The game uses a palette of pastel colours and same colour but in the bright tone to assembly a different mordern design. The colour palette was created using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.

**Typography**

Google Fonts was used for the following font with different font weight:

* Work Sans is used on the whole website. It is a sans-serif font.

**Imagery**

All media was created by myself.

**Wireframes**

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop.

  * Add a sharing button to allow users share their restuls.

**Accessibility**

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text - such as the help button and footer section icons.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
* Provide clear intructions content.

### JavaScript Test
The Jest tests present on this project was hard to implement has structure did not follow each other between the files. Only one test was implemented to test if the sequence was being displayed correctly and this test pass. So the decision to implement manual tests was giving to be able to still test for functionality. 
This framework washard to follow and understand the test driven development, as a final statement Jest will be implemented in others projects but before more pratice is required to use it in a time sentive project.

## Credits

**Code Used**

- boostrap pop up code was not working so I searched online and found automatic pop-up screen code to show automated and allow user interaction with it. Changes were added to follow the appropriate purpose. [Coding Artist - Automatic Pop-Up Javascript](https://codingartistweb.com/2021/08/show-popup-automatically-after-page-load-using-javascript/)

- The below codes was provided by my friend that was helping solve the gameplay problem:
async function delay(time) {
  return await new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(resolve, time);
  });
}

const getRandomValue = (obj) => {
  let arr = Object.keys(obj);
  return arr[Math.floor(Math.random() * arr.length)];
};
