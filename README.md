## Testing

Testing was ongoing throughout the entire build. I utilised Chrome developer tools while building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as I went along.

The following issues were raised during my mid project meeting with my mentor:

* The first version of the website support a carrosel section but was not working properly. This lastest version get rid of carrosel section.
* All images was not responsive to small screen devices. The images now is fully reponsive and present a grid for a better follow on the website.
* The navagation bar was not showing up on small devices. It now present a collapse content and center.
* The date field on booking section was not appearing. It required a change on the date field class and data-target.

### W3C Validator

The W3C validator was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website. It was also used to validate CSS in the style.css file.

* [Index Page HTML](assets/documentation-media/index-validator.png)
* [Destination Page HTML with errors stated](assets/documentation-media/destinations-error-validator.png)
* [Destination Page HTML with solved](assets/documentation-media/destinations-validator.png)
* [About Page HTML](assets/documentation-media/about-validator.png)
* [style.css CSS](assets/documentation-media/css-validator.png)

### Solved Bugs

1. The hero section would lose its alignment when on smaller devices, with a font size much bigger than the screen proportion. CSS queries is necessary suit the font size according to the screen proportion. Also, aligment with padding and background image were adjust to fit.

2. The button on navagation bar has to be adjust to be able to work as a link. By remove link tag and add a onclick event.

3. The navigation bar present on the pages with light background had to be adjust to fit the page. By adding a different class to style to CSS and named it 'navigation dark'.

4. The back to top function was implemented to improve usuability, with that in mind a Javascript file and code had to be added for a fully functionality.
