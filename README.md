## Testing

Testing was ongoing throughout the entire build. I utilised Chrome developer tools while building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as I went along.

The following issues were raised during my mid project meeting with my mentor:

* The first version of the website support a carrosel section but was not working properly. This lastest version get rid of carrosel section.
* All images was not responsive to small screen devices. The images now is fully reponsive and present a grid for a better follow on the website.
* The navagation bar was not showing up on small devices. It now present a collapse content and center.
* The date field on booking section was not appearing. It required a change on the date field class and data-target.

### W3C Validator

The W3C validator was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website. It was also used to validate CSS in the style.css file.

* [HTML Validator](assets/documentation-media/Html-w3-validator.png)
* [CSS Validator](assets/documentation-media/Css-w3-validator.png)

### Solved Bugs

1. ColourPart loop was put into a function to only initiate when the user click on 'Start' button. This way will prevent 'undefine' code and disable clickable colours to only active once start.

2. The feedback 'You stopped at level: ... ' code is fixed on JavaScript file due to misspelled error.
