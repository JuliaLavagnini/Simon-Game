### Features

The website is comprised of three pages, all accessible from the navigation menu (home page, destination page & about us page).

* All Pages on the website have:

  * A responsive navigation bar at the top which allows the user to navigate through the site.  To the left of the navigation bar is an image of travrl agency logo. To the right of the navigation bar are the links to the websites pages (home, destinations, and about us). To allow a good user experience of the site, the TRIP. text is hidden with a media query on mobile devices to prevent the navigation bar looking cluttered. When viewing with mobile devices the navigation links change to a burger toggler. This was implemented to give the site a clean look and to promote a good user experience, as users are used to seeing the burger icon when on mobile devices to navigate a site.
  * On the navigation bar there is a button "get started" that will send the user imediatly to the bookind section.

* Home Page.
  * Popular Destination Section.
  The images are aligned in a grid system with zoom in when hover and access to the the specific destination aligned with the image on destination page.

  * Our Services Section.
  This section section changes each box color when hover to orange for a nice interaction.

  * Awesome Package Section.
  This section allows the user to see some packages and click for more information which will send them to destinations page, or send to book section. Each book now button will open the booking section on a new tab.

  * Booking Section.
  This section allows the user to book a trip with form interaction. After click "book now" a popup message will appear showing the order ID, a contact number in case of need and a message saying an agent will contact shortly. 

  * Newsletter Section.
  It will give to the user a chance to stay informed about trip, deals, article, tips and more. It will be shown on a popup message after put email and click "join our newsletter".

  * Create social media for a better engagement with potential users. 

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
* Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text - such as the review ratings for books & footer icons.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
* Ensuring menus are accessible by marking the current page as current for screen readers.

## Testing

Testing was ongoing throughout the entire build. I utilised Chrome developer tools while building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as I went along.

The following issues were raised during my mid project meeting with my mentor:

* The first version of the website support a carrosel section but was not working properly. This lastest version get rid of carrosel section.
* All images was not responsive to small screen devices. The images now is fully reponsive and present a grid for a better follow on the website.
* The navagation bar was not showing up on small devices. It now present a collapse content and center.
* The date field on booking section was not appearing. It required a change on the date field class and data-target.

### W3C Validator

The W3C validator was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website. It was also used to validate CSS in the style.css file.

* [Index Page HTML](assets/documentation-media/index-validator.png)
* [Destination Page HTML with errors stated](assets/documentation-media/destinations-error-validator.png)
* [Destination Page HTML with solved](assets/documentation-media/destinations-validator.png)
* [About Page HTML](assets/documentation-media/about-validator.png)
* [style.css CSS](assets/documentation-media/css-validator.png)

### Solved Bugs

1. The hero section would lose its alignment when on smaller devices, with a font size much bigger than the screen proportion. CSS queries is necessary suit the font size according to the screen proportion. Also, aligment with padding and background image were adjust to fit.

2. The button on navagation bar has to be adjust to be able to work as a link. By remove link tag and add a onclick event.

3. The navigation bar present on the pages with light background had to be adjust to fit the page. By adding a different class to style to CSS and named it 'navigation dark'.

4. The back to top function was implemented to improve usuability, with that in mind a Javascript file and code had to be added for a fully functionality.
